Implement an MAB algorithm for the medical trial situation:
  Three different treatments, each with uncertain
  performance, defined as the welfare of a patient after
  the treatment.

  Help the doctor to prescribe a treatment at one time.
  
  Display how the estimated value of each treatment
  evolves with time.
  
  Display how the average reward you have obtained evolves.
